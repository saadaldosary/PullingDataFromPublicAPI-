# PullingDataFromPublicAPI-

-In this app, i made swift app that pull the data from public API, i utilized hackerNews public API, but you can change that to what ever api you need. In case your APIs has token and security code, you can edit the file networkManger file in Fetch data function. 
- note that, the app made by SwiftUI which is farely new, and would be constently updating. 
- I made webView using WebKit from UIkit due to that SwiftUI still does not have webview model.
- This app could be embbeded in larger app.
